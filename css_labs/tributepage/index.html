            <p>Alan Turing (1912-1954) was a British mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst,
                philosopher, and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical
                computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing
                machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer.</p>
            <p>Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.
                During World War II, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park,
                Britain's codebreaking centre. He devised several techniques for speeding the breaking of German
                ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method, an electromechanical machine that
                could find settings for the Enigma machine.</p>
            <p>Despite his crucial contributions to the war effort, Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts.
                He accepted chemical castration treatment as an alternative to prison. Turing died in 1954, just weeks
                before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide poisoning. An inquest determined his death as a suicide, but it
                has also been considered an accidental poisoning.</p>
            <p>In 2009, following an internet campaign, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public
                apology on behalf of the British government for "the appalling way he was treated". Queen Elizabeth II
                granted him a posthumous royal pardon in 2013. The "Turing law" in the UK is now informally used to
                refer to a 2017 law that retroactively pardoned men convicted under historical legislation outlawing
                homosexual acts.</p>
